# eha2

This is an R package under development. It is supposed to eventually replace 
the CRAN package _eha_. The main purpose of _eha2_ and _eha_ is to give tools
for survival and event history analysis. 

Compared to the CRAN package _eha_, _eha2_ is more lightweight: The overlap
with the CRAN package _glmmML_ is cut off, and the part of _coxreg_ that
competes with the _survival_ package _coxph_ will be is toned down.

On the other hand, two new tracks are introduced: (i) Methods for register
based data, and (ii) modes of presentation of results, buth graphically
and in tables.
